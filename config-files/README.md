# config-files
Some configuration files I use.

## Script explanation

**init.vim**: Neovim configuration file. The following packages need to be installed:
- neovim (obviously)
- vim-plug (from github)
- exuberant-ctags (from apt)
- nodeJS (latest version)
- npm (included with node)
- yarn (from npm, and installed on coc.nvim directory)
- coc language files (coc.clangd for c language, for instance)
